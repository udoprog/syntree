//!
//! A memory efficient syntax tree.
//!
//! This crate provides a tree structure which always is contiguously stored and
//! manipulated in memory. It provides similar APIs as [`rowan`] and is intended
//! to be an efficient replacement for it (read more below).
//!
//! Anything can be stored in the tree as long as it implements `Copy`.
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Add `syntree` to your crate:
//!
//! ```toml
//! syntree = "0.18.0"
//! ```
//!
//! If you want a complete sample for how `syntree` can be used for parsing, see
//! the [calculator example][calculator].
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! ## Syntax trees
//!
//! This crate provides a way to efficiently model [abstract syntax trees]. The
//! nodes of the tree are typically represented by variants in an enum, but
//! [could be whatever you want][any-syntax].
//!
//! Each tree consists of *nodes* and *tokens*. Nodes are intermediary elements
//! in the tree which encapsulate zero or more other nodes or tokens, while
//! tokens are leaf elements representing exact source locations.
//!
//! An example tree for the simple expression `256 / 2 + 64 * 2` could be
//! represented like this:
//!
//! ```text
//! Operation@0..16
//!   Number@0..3
//!     Number@0..3 "256"
//!   Whitespace@3..4 " "
//!   Operator@4..5
//!     Div@4..5 "/"
//!   Whitespace@5..6 " "
//!   Number@6..7
//!     Number@6..7 "2"
//!   Whitespace@7..8 " "
//!   Operator@8..9
//!     Plus@8..9 "+"
//!   Whitespace@9..10 " "
//!   Operation@10..16
//!     Number@10..12
//!       Number@10..12 "64"
//!     Whitespace@12..13 " "
//!     Operator@13..14
//!       Mul@13..14 "*"
//!     Whitespace@14..15 " "
//!     Number@15..16
//!       Number@15..16 "2"
//! ```
//!
//! > Try it for yourself with:
//! >
//! > ```sh
//! > cargo run --example calculator -- "256 / 2 + 64 * 2"
//! > ```
//!
//! The primary difference between `syntree` and [`rowan`] is that *we don't
//! store the original source* in the syntax tree. Instead, the user of the
//! library is responsible for providing it as necessary. Like when calling
//! [`print_with_source`].
//!
//! The API for constructing a syntax tree is provided through [`Builder`] which
//! implements streaming builder methods. Internally the builder is represented
//! as a contiguous slab of memory. Once a tree is built the structure of the
//! tree can be queried through the [`Tree`] type.
//!
//! Note that [`syntree::tree!`] is only a helper which simplifies building
//! trees for examples. It corresponds exactly to performing [`open`],
//! [`close`], and [`token`] calls on [`Builder`] as specified.
//!
//! ```
//! use syntree::{Builder, Span};
//!
//! #[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq)]
//! enum Syntax {
//!     Number,
//!     Lit,
//!     Nested,
//! }
//!
//! use Syntax::*;
//!
//! let mut tree = Builder::new();
//!
//! tree.open(Number)?;
//! tree.token(Lit, 1)?;
//! tree.token(Lit, 3)?;
//!
//! tree.open(Nested)?;
//! tree.token(Lit, 1)?;
//! tree.close()?;
//!
//! tree.close()?;
//!
//! let tree = tree.build()?;
//!
//! let expected = syntree::tree! {
//!     Number => {
//!         (Lit, 1),
//!         (Lit, 3),
//!         Nested => {
//!             (Lit, 1)
//!         }
//!     }
//! };
//!
//! assert_eq!(tree, expected);
//!
//! let number = tree.first().ok_or("missing number")?;
//! assert_eq!(number.span(), Span::new(0, 5));
//! # Ok::<_, Box<dyn core::error::Error>>(())
//! ```
//!
//! Note how the resulting [`Span`] for `Number` corresponds to the full span of
//! its `Lit` children. Including the ones within `Nested`.
//!
//! Trees are usually constructed by parsing an input. This library encourages
//! the use of a [handwritten pratt parser][pratt]. See the [calculator
//! example][calculator] for a complete use case.
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! ## Compact or empty spans
//!
//! Spans by default uses `u32`-based indexes and `usize`-based pointers, this
//! can be changed from its default using the [`Builder::new_with`] constructor:
//!
//! ```
//! use syntree::{Builder, Span, Tree};
//!
//! syntree::flavor! {
//!     struct FlavorU16 {
//!         type Index = usize;
//!         type Width = u16;
//!     }
//! };
//!
//! syntree::flavor! {
//!     struct FlavorU32 {
//!         type Index = usize;
//!         type Width = u32;
//!     }
//! };
//!
//! let mut tree = Builder::<_, FlavorU16>::new_with();
//!
//! tree.open("root")?;
//! tree.open("child")?;
//! tree.token("token", 100)?;
//! tree.close()?;
//! tree.open("child2")?;
//! tree.close()?;
//! tree.close()?;
//!
//! let tree = tree.build()?;
//!
//! let expected: Tree<_, FlavorU32> = syntree::tree_with! {
//!     "root" => {
//!         "child" => { ("token", 100) },
//!         "child2" => {}
//!     }
//! };
//!
//! assert_eq!(tree, expected);
//! assert_eq!(tree.span(), Span::new(0, 100));
//! # Ok::<_, Box<dyn core::error::Error>>(())
//! ```
//!
//! Combined with [`Empty`], this allows for building trees without spans, if
//! that is something you want to do:
//!
//! ```
//! use syntree::{Builder, Empty, EmptyVec, TreeIndex, Tree};
//!
//! syntree::flavor! {
//!     struct FlavorEmpty {
//!         type Index = Empty;
//!         type Indexes = EmptyVec<TreeIndex<Self>>;
//!     }
//! };
//!
//! let mut tree = Builder::<_, FlavorEmpty>::new_with();
//!
//! tree.open("root")?;
//! tree.open("child")?;
//! tree.token("token", Empty)?;
//! tree.close()?;
//! tree.open("child2")?;
//! tree.close()?;
//! tree.close()?;
//!
//! let tree = tree.build()?;
//!
//! let expected: Tree<_, FlavorEmpty> = syntree::tree_with! {
//!     "root" => {
//!         "child" => { "token" },
//!         "child2" => {}
//!     }
//! };
//!
//! assert_eq!(tree, expected);
//! assert!(tree.span().is_empty());
//! # Ok::<_, Box<dyn core::error::Error>>(())
//! ```
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! ## Why not `rowan`?
//!
//! I love [`rowan`]. It's the reason why I started this project. But this crate
//! still exists for a few philosophical differences that would be hard to
//! reconcile directly in `rowan`.
//!
//! `rowan` only supports adding types which in some way can be coerced into an
//! `repr(u16)` as part of the syntax tree. I think this decision is reasonable,
//! but it precludes you from designing trees which contain anything else other
//! than source references without having to perform some form of indirect
//! lookup. This is something needed in order to move [Rune] to lossless syntax
//! trees (see [the representation of `Kind::Str` variant][kind-str]).
//!
//! To exemplify this scenario consider the following syntax:
//!
//! ```
//! #[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
//! enum Syntax {
//!     /// A string referenced somewhere else using the provided ID.
//!     Synthetic(usize),
//!     /// A literal string from the source.
//!     Lit,
//!     /// Whitespace.
//!     Whitespace,
//!     /// A lexer error.
//!     Error,
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! You can see the [full `synthetic_strings` example][synthetic_strings] for
//! how this might be used. But not only can the `Synthetic` token correspond to
//! some source location (as it should because it was expanded from one!). It
//! also directly represents that it's *not* a literal string referencing a
//! source location.
//!
//! In [Rune] this became needed once we started [expanding
//! macros][rune-macros]. Because macros expand to things which do not reference
//! source locations so we need some other mechanism to include what the tokens
//! represent in the syntax trees.
//!
//! You can try a *very* simple lex-time variable expander in the
//! [`synthetic_strings` example][synthetic_strings]:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo run --example synthetic_strings -- "Hello $world"
//! ```
//!
//! Which would output:
//!
//! ```text
//! Tree:
//! Lit@0..5 "Hello"
//! Whitespace@5..6 " "
//! Synthetic(0)@6..12 "$world"
//! Eval:
//! 0 = "Hello"
//! 1 = "Earth"
//! ```
//!
//! So in essence `syntree` doesn't believe you need to store strings in the
//! tree itself. Even if you want to deduplicate string storage. All of that can
//! be done on the side and encoded into the syntax tree as you wish.
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! ### Errors instead of panics
//!
//! Another point where this crate differs is that we rely on propagating a
//! [`Error`] during tree construction if the API is used incorrectly
//! *instead* of panicking.
//!
//! While on the surface this might seem like a minor difference in opinion on
//! whether programming mistakes should be errors or not. In my experience
//! parsers tend to be part of a crate in a larger project. And errors triggered
//! by edge cases in user-provided input that once encountered can usually be
//! avoided.
//!
//! So let's say [Rune] is embedded in [OxidizeBot] and there's a piece of code
//! in a user-provided script which triggers a bug in the rune compiler. Which
//! in turn causes an illegal tree to be constructed. If tree construction
//! simply panics, the whole bot will go down. But if we instead propagate an
//! error this would have to be handled in [OxidizeBot] which could panic if it
//! wanted to. In this instance it's simply more appropriate to log the error
//! and unload the script (and hopefully receive a bug report!) than to crash
//! the bot.
//!
//! Rust has great diagnostics for indicating that results should be handled,
//! and while it is [more awkward to deal with results][syntree-math] than [to
//! simply panic][rowan-math] I believe that the end result is more robust
//! software.
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! ## Performance and memory use
//!
//! The only goal in terms of performance is to be as performant as `rowan`. And
//! cursory testing shows `syntree` to be a bit faster on synthetic workloads
//! which can probably be solely attributed to storing and manipulating the
//! entire tree in a single contiguous memory region. This might or might not
//! change in the future, depending on if the needs for `syntree` changes. While
//! performance is important, it *is not* a primary focus.
//!
//! I also expect (but haven't verified) that `syntree` could end up having a
//! similarly low memory profile as `rowan` which performs node deduplication.
//! The one caveat is that it depends on how the original source is stored and
//! queried. Something which `rowan` solves for you, but `syntree` leaves as an
//! exercise to the reader.
